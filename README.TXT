This project was aimed to  familiarise myself with movement system implementation.
I successfully achieved my goal and created the game.
You are - 1.
You need to move around the field using wasd inputs and pressing enter to process
each move. £ is the enemy. Each time you make a step, he attacks you with 1 damage
and has 1% chance to deal 2 damage. Each time you attack him, he teleports to a random tile on the map.
You deal to him 1-3 damage randomly. 3 healthpacks are generated on the field after each your attack.
S - heals you full health
H - heals 7-9 health
h - heals 2-4 health
